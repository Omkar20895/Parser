# Parser
Parsers for XML SGML and HTML in python. 
The HTML parser is a basic parser which iterates through a directory and parses every html file in it and stores them in seperate txt files in the same directory.
The SGML and XML parser is a combined parser which just parses a single SGML/XML document and prints the data in the bash.
